# CoevolPhageTraining
2020-11-09 -- This repository was created to make available data and code relevant to my project on coevolutionary phage training in lambda.

Within the repository are folders that correspond to figures from the manuscript, and within each of these folders are the code and relevant data to create the figure.

Metadata from genome sequences can be found in the "sequencing" folder, however the raw sequences have been deposited at the NCBI.
